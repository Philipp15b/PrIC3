In a PRISM Program:

    - We have exactly one module called main
    - the model needs do be deterministic
    - all constants are defined
    - All Integer/Boolean Variables are declared in main
    - All variables are initialized (using init in variable declarations)
    - There must be a label called "guard"
    - There muste be a label called "goal"
    -
    ---------- The following should be supported. More would be nice.------------
    - Supported (Binary) Arithmetic expressions: +,-,/
    - Supported (Unary) Arithmetic expressions: -
    - Supported Binary Numerical Relations: =, !=, < , <= , >=, >
    - Supported (Binary) Boolean operations: and, or
    - Supported (Unary) Boolean operations: not
    - Support if-then-else expressions?
